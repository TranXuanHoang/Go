## 3rd-Party Packages

The app uses the following 3rd-party packages

| Package | Type | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| [react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) | `production` | A JavaScript library for creating user interfaces, contains only the functionality necessary to define React components, and is typically used together with a React renderer like react-dom for the web |
| [react-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom) | `production` | Serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React |
| [react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scripts) | `production` | Includes scripts and configuration used by [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) |
| [web-vitals](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-vitals) | `production` | a tiny (~1K), modular library for measuring all the [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) metrics on real users, in a way that accurately matches how they're measured by Chrome and reported to other Google tools (e.g. Chrome User Experience Report, Page Speed Insights, Search Console's Speed Report) |
| [prop-types](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prop-types) | `production` | Runtime type checking for React props |
